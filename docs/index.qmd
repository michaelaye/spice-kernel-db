## What is this?

`spice-kernel-db` is a tool for getting and managing NAIF SPICE kernels across planetary missions. The primary workflow is: **set up a mission, browse remote metakernels, and get everything you need with one command**.

The tool supports multiple SPICE servers (NASA NAIF and ESA SPICE), downloads kernels in parallel, automatically creates symlinks organized by mission, and generates ready-to-use metakernels. You can browse what's available on remote servers before downloading, and the acquisition process handles all dependencies automatically.

After acquisition, the metakernel is immediately usable — existing kernels already in the database are automatically linked into the download tree so all relative paths resolve correctly. Optional content-addressed deduplication (using SHA-256 hashing) can further reduce storage when working with multiple missions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install spice-kernel-db
```

Or with conda:

```bash
conda install -c michaelaye spice-kernel-db
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelaye/spice-kernel-db
cd spice-kernel-db
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick taste

```bash
# First run: configure storage path (or re-run with --setup)
spice-kernel-db config

# Add a mission (interactive dialog chooses server and base URL)
spice-kernel-db mission add

# Browse available remote metakernels
spice-kernel-db browse JUICE

# Get kernels from a remote metakernel (parallel downloads, auto-symlink, ready to use)
spice-kernel-db get https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/JUICE/kernels/mk/juice_crema_5_1.tm

# Use the locally rewritten metakernel with spiceypy
spiceypy.furnsh("/your/storage/path/symlinks/JUICE/juice_crema_5_1.tm")
```
